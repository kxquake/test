# Property-Tycoon

NOTE
================================================================
1. Have project image pngs in a file named 'pngs' as that is where the code will load the images from (you may need to create the 'pngs' folder yourself for now)
2. For now, run the game from menu2.py (not main.py)
3. Make sure to have pygame / python installed on your system / device.
